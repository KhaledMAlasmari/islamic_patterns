Throughout the years Islamic art has been used everywhere related to Islam, as we can see it in our daily lives in mosques and furnishings. Additionally, Islamic art has been fascinating in the eyes of any artist. As it exposes people to the art of geometry, history of the Islamic world and aesthetic. Furthermore, Islamic art has not only been used in Islamic countries, China used it in building on of the largest mosques in Xian. It has been built since 742 by Tang Dynasty and has been reformed in 1384 to it is current form by Emperor Hongwu.

Similar to China, India used Islamic architecture to create one of the most fascinating art in the world, which called Taj Mahal.

Figure 3. Taj Mahal, Agra, India

This place has been referenced in many movies and comics like Aladdin. Because of how beautiful it is it did inspire a lot of architects in India since there is a percentage of Muslims there.

Since we are computer science students with no taste In drawing, our best solution is to find an Islamic pattern and using it as a reference to draw it using Java language.

Figure 4. Islamic Pattern Reference

As we can see we can divide the shape to five main points:
• Background
• Arrow line
• Polygon
• Inner triangle ( polygon )
• Dots ( between outer polygon )

From the reference we can see it is one arrow rotated 8 times, to be a total of 360 degree to create a circle.

Now we need to make it go as a circle, we will draw it 8 times , each time rotate it 45 degree.
